Homework 03 - Password Generator

Motivation: Making a random password generator, obeying specific rules and giving specific options for the user to choose from. Taking the utility point of view, this activity is extremely useful, for all sorts of situations.

In this case specifically, is just a website for personal use, letting the user choose from 4 different types of characters and a size between 8 and 128 for his random password. It has good flexibility and a strong method, making it a reliable tool for anyone that wants a new password.

From the point of view of a developer, was a great way to work with javascript and manipulate the random number function and mixing it with strings. Since the 'random' factor is a primal concept of security, this covers a great topic which developers must face on a daily basis, not only for user passwords, but security keys, which are generated all the time on the internet.



A few features:

- simple and userfriendly interface
- reliable method through javascript
